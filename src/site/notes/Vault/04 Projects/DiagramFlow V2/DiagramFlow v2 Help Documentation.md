# DiagramFlow v2 Help System

Welcome to **DiagramFlow v2**, a plain‑text language for describing *any* architectural or logic flow with absolute clarity and zero visual noise.  
This documentation is divided into standalone pages—one per concept—so you can jump straight to the piece you need.

## Why DiagramFlow?
* **Human‑first clarity:** Perfect for pasting into LLM chats or code reviews.  
* **Expressive:** Covers sequential, parallel, async, error, event, guard, metadata, side‑effect, and sub‑flow patterns.  
* **Lightweight:** No external tooling required.  
* **Composable:** Flows can reference other flows, enabling large systems to be modelled in layers.

## Getting Started
1. Open [[Vault/04 Projects/DiagramFlow V2/syntax_overview\|syntax_overview]] for a five‑minute crash course.  
2. Browse [[Vault/04 Projects/DiagramFlow V2/nodes\|nodes]], [[Vault/04 Projects/DiagramFlow V2/edges\|edges]], and [[Vault/04 Projects/DiagramFlow V2/attributes\|attributes]] for deep dives.  
3. Scan [[Vault/04 Projects/DiagramFlow V2/patterns\|patterns]] for ready‑made flow templates.  
4. Copy‑paste snippets from [[Vault/04 Projects/DiagramFlow V2/examples\|Vault/04 Projects/DiagramFlow V2/examples]] to kick‑start your own docs.
